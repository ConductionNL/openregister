## 🎯 **Import Methods Ready for Extraction**

### In ConfigurationService (awaiting extraction):
1. `importFromJson()` - **866 lines** (lines 570-1435)
2. `importFromApp()` - **1,063 lines** (lines ~1530-2593)
3. `importFromFilePath()` - **94 lines** (lines ~1436-1530)
4. `importConfigurationWithSelection()` - **527 lines** (lines ~2593+)

### Helper Methods:
5. `importRegister()` - 57 lines
6. `importSchema()` - 300+ lines (very complex!)
7. `createOrUpdateConfiguration()` - 150 lines
8. `handleDuplicateRegisterError()` - TBD

**Total:** ~2,400 lines ready for systematic extraction
