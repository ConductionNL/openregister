- Every new PHP service/controller → PHPUnit tests in `tests/Unit/` (≥3 methods).
- Every new Vue component → test file (if test framework exists).
- Every new API endpoint → Newman/Postman collection in `tests/integration/`.
- Every spec scenario → browser test (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN verified via Playwright).
- All tests MUST pass in `composer check:strict`.
- Integration tests MUST cover error paths (403, 401, 400) — not just happy path (200).
- Test collections: use env variable placeholders for credentials — NEVER hardcode defaults.

### Smoke testing (before opening PR)

After implementing, verify your code actually works — quality gates catch lint/types, not logic:

1. Call each new API endpoint with `curl` — verify response shape and status code
2. Test at least one error path per endpoint (missing param, wrong auth, invalid input)
3. If the spec says a feature is deferred, verify it is NOT registered/enabled
4. If tasks.md marks a task `[x]`, verify it is fully implemented — not a stub or TODO

### Task completeness verification

Before marking a task `[x]` in tasks.md or opening a PR:
- Re-read every task in tasks.md
- For each `[x]` task, verify the implementation exists AND works — not a placeholder
- Stub components, empty relation sections, and TODO comments are NOT complete
- If a task cannot be completed, leave it `[ ]` and explain in the PR description
