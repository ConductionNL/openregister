# Gneral rules for workin add Conduction as an AI

You are a senior programmer at an innovation-oriented development company. You always make a detailed plan before writing anything, but are able to think outside the box and suggest alternative methods. 

## Documentation
- Icons should be part of https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/
- Layout should follow https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/design/layoutcomponents.html 
- Components can be used from https://nextcloud-vue-components.netlify.app/
- We use docusarus to document our code and functionality, docs should places in /website/docs
- We support and should use mermaid diagrams in our documentation to explain processes

## Testing 
We are developing a nextcloud application that has a back and frontend, all our bussen logic should therfore be accible trough api. All backend busnes logic that you write should be tested by mkaing api calls.  

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **❌ DO NOT** make API calls from the host machine to `http://localhost` or `http://nextcloud.local`
   - These will result in 401 Unauthorized errors
   - Authentication cookies and sessions don't work properly from external calls

2. **❌ DO NOT** use standalone PHP server for API testing
   - `php -S localhost:8000` lacks the Nextcloud framework and routing system
   - API routes will return 404 errors
   - Dependency injection and service container won't work

3. **❌ DO NOT** forget authentication headers
   - Always include `-u 'admin:admin'` for basic auth
   - Always include `-H 'OCS-APIREQUEST: true'` header


3. **❌ DO NOT** user error_log
   - Use psr logger instead 


#### 1. REQUIRED: Test from within the Docker Container
Execute curl commands from inside the Nextcloud Docker container:

**Step 1: Find your Nextcloud container name**
```bash
# List running containers to find Nextcloud container
docker ps | grep nextcloud
```

**Step 2: Test API from within container (REQUIRED for local development)**
```bash
# Execute curl command in the container (replace 'master-nextcloud-1' with your container name)
docker exec -it -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 bash -c "curl -u 'admin:admin' -H 'http://localhost/index.php/apps/openregister/api/objects/6/35?extend=deelnemers'"

# For statistics endpoint specifically
docker exec -it -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 bash -c "curl -u 'admin:admin' -H 'http://localhost/index.php/apps/openregister/api/search-trails/statistics'"

# Or get a shell in the container for interactive testing
docker exec -it -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 /bin/bash

#### 2. External API Testing (Production/Staging Only)
For external access, use the proper domain:

```bash
# For external access (production/staging environments only)
curl -u 'admin:admin' -H  \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     'http://nextcloud.local/index.php/apps/openregister/api/objects/6/35'
```

**Note:** External calls require proper DNS resolution and may not work in all local development environments.

#### 3. Required Headers for API Testing
Always include these headers when testing:
```bash
# Test with authentication headers (REQUIRED)
curl -u 'admin:admin' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     'http://localhost/index.php/apps/openregister/api/search-trails/statistics'
```

We alwasy test first form the command line, but when the test is completed we should create a newman test in order to protect the functionality against feuture changes.

### Testing Bulk Import Functionality

**Test Normal Object Creation:**
```bash
# Test single object creation to verify API is working
docker exec -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 curl -s -u 'admin:admin' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'OCS-APIREQUEST: true' \
  'http://localhost/index.php/apps/openregister/api/objects/19/105' \
  -d '{
    "naam": "Test Organisation",
    "website": "https://test.example.com",
    "type": "Test"
  }' | jq -r '{uuid: .id, name: .naam, published: ."@self".published}'
```

**Test Bulk Import with organisatie.csv:**
```bash
# Get object count before import
before_count=$(docker exec -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 curl -s -u 'admin:admin' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  'http://localhost/index.php/apps/openregister/api/objects?register=19&schema=105' | jq -r '.total // 0')
echo "Objects before: $before_count"

# Perform bulk import using repository CSV file
docker exec -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 curl -s -u 'admin:admin' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'OCS-APIREQUEST: true' \
  'http://localhost/index.php/apps/openregister/api/import/19/105' \
  -F "file=@/var/www/html/apps-extra/openregister/lib/Settings/organisatie.csv"

# Check object count after import
after_count=$(docker exec -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 curl -s -u 'admin:admin' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  'http://localhost/index.php/apps/openregister/api/objects?register=19&schema=105' | jq -r '.total // 0')
echo "Objects after: $after_count"
echo "Imported: $(($after_count - $before_count))"
```

**Verify Import in Database:**
```bash
# Check if objects were actually saved to database
docker exec -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 mysql -h master-database-mysql-1 -u nextcloud -pnextcloud nextcloud -e "
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_objects 
FROM oc_openregister_objects 
WHERE register = 19 AND schema = 105;
"

# Check recent objects with auto-publish status
docker exec -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 mysql -h master-database-mysql-1 -u nextcloud -pnextcloud nextcloud -e "
SELECT 
    LEFT(id, 8) as short_id,
    name,
    published IS NOT NULL as auto_published,
    created,
    published
FROM oc_openregister_objects 
WHERE register = 19 AND schema = 105 
ORDER BY created DESC 
LIMIT 5;
"
``` 

### Debugging API Endpoint Issues

#### 1. Check App Status
Ensure the app is enabled in Nextcloud:
```bash
# Check if app is enabled (replace 'master-nextcloud-1' with your container name)
docker exec -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 php /var/www/html/occ app:list | grep openregister

# Enable the app if needed
docker exec -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 php /var/www/html/occ app:enable openregister

# Verify app is enabled (should show 'openregister already enabled')
docker exec -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 php /var/www/html/occ app:enable openregister
```

#### 2. View Debug Logs (CORRECT METHOD)
For local development, debug logs appear in the Docker container's stdout, not in the Nextcloud log file:

```bash
# View real-time debug logs from Docker stdout
docker logs -f master-nextcloud-1

# Or view recent logs
docker logs master-nextcloud-1 | tail -n 100

# Filter for specific debug messages
docker logs master-nextcloud-1 | grep -E '\[SaveObject\]|\[ObjectService\]|\[ObjectsController\]'

# View logs for specific time period
docker logs master-nextcloud-1 --since 10m | grep '\[SaveObject\]'
```

**Important**: Debug logs with `error_log()` calls appear in Docker stdout, not in `/var/www/html/data/nextcloud.log`. The Nextcloud log file only contains framework-level logs and errors.

#### 2. Verify Routes Configuration
Check that routes are properly defined in `appinfo/routes.php`:
```php
// Ensure routes are properly defined
['name' => 'controller#method', 'url' => '/api/endpoint', 'verb' => 'GET'],
```

#### 3. Check Controller Methods
Verify that controller methods have proper annotations:
```php
/**
 * @NoAdminRequired
 * @NoCSRFRequired
 */
public function statistics(): JSONResponse
{
    // Method implementation
}
```

#### 5. Database Configuration & Testing

**Get Database Configuration from Nextcloud:**
```bash
# Extract database configuration from Nextcloud config
docker exec -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 php -r "
\$config = include '/var/www/html/config/config.php';
echo 'DB_HOST=' . \$config['dbhost'] . PHP_EOL;
echo 'DB_NAME=' . \$config['dbname'] . PHP_EOL;  
echo 'DB_USER=' . \$config['dbuser'] . PHP_EOL;
echo 'DB_PASSWORD=' . \$config['dbpassword'] . PHP_EOL;
echo 'DB_PREFIX=' . (\$config['dbtableprefix'] ?? 'oc_') . PHP_EOL;
"
```

**Common Docker Development Setup:**
```bash
# Typical development database configuration:
DB_HOST=master-database-mysql-1
DB_NAME=nextcloud
DB_USER=nextcloud
DB_PASSWORD=nextcloud
DB_PREFIX=oc_

# OpenRegister specific tables:
# - oc_openregister_objects
# - oc_openregister_schemas  
# - oc_openregister_registers
# - oc_openregister_sources
# - oc_openregister_organisations
```

**Direct Database Access:**
```bash
# Connect to database directly from container
docker exec -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 mysql -h master-database-mysql-1 -u nextcloud -pnextcloud nextcloud

# Query object counts by register/schema
docker exec -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 mysql -h master-database-mysql-1 -u nextcloud -pnextcloud nextcloud -e "
SELECT 
    register,
    schema,
    COUNT(*) as count 
FROM oc_openregister_objects 
GROUP BY register, schema 
ORDER BY register, schema;
"

# Check for recently created objects
docker exec -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 mysql -h master-database-mysql-1 -u nextcloud -pnextcloud nextcloud -e "
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    published,
    created 
FROM oc_openregister_objects 
WHERE register = 19 AND schema = 105 
ORDER BY created DESC 
LIMIT 10;
"
```

**Test Database Connectivity:**
```bash
# Test database connection and query
docker exec -u 33 master-nextcloud-1 php -r "
\$config = include '/var/www/html/config/config.php';
\$pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=' . \$config['dbhost'] . ';dbname=' . \$config['dbname'], \$config['dbuser'], \$config['dbpassword']);
var_dump(\$pdo->query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM oc_openregister_objects')->fetchColumn());
"
```
