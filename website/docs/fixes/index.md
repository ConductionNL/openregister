# Fixes Overview

This section contains documentation for fixes and solutions implemented in OpenRegister to address specific issues and improve system stability.

## Available Fixes

### [Entity __toString() Magic Method Fix](./ENTITY_TOSTRING_FIX.md)
**Issue**: Object entities could not be saved due to string conversion errors when the framework attempted to convert entity objects to strings.

**Solution**: Added `__toString()` magic methods to all entity classes and fixed organisation handling logic in the SaveObject service.

**Impact**: Resolves object entity saving errors and prevents similar string conversion issues across all entity operations.

### [Organisation Default Fix](./ORGANISATION_DEFAULT_FIX.md)
**Issue**: Import functionality failing on production with missing default organisation methods.

**Solution**: Added missing methods to `OrganisationMapper`, enhanced `Organisation` entity, and created migration for `is_default` column.

**Impact**: Resolves production import errors and ensures proper multi-tenancy support.

### [Folder Deletion Fix](./FOLDER_DELETION_FIX.md)
**Issue**: Import errors when reusing UUIDs due to orphaned folders from previous deletions.

**Solution**: Enhanced hard delete process to clean up folders, improved multiple folder handling, and added foundation for automated cleanup.

**Impact**: Prevents import errors with reused UUIDs and ensures complete resource cleanup.
