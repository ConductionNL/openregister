# Fixes Documentation

This folder contains documentation for fixes and solutions implemented in OpenRegister to address specific issues and improve system stability.

## Purpose

The fixes documentation serves several important purposes:

1. **Knowledge Preservation**: Document solutions to prevent similar issues in the future
2. **Deployment Reference**: Provide clear instructions for applying fixes in production
3. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Help developers understand and resolve similar issues
4. **Change Tracking**: Maintain a record of system improvements and bug fixes

## Documentation Standards

Each fix should include:

### Required Sections
- **Problem Description**: Clear explanation of the issue with error messages
- **Root Cause**: Why the problem occurred and contributing factors
- **Solution Implemented**: Detailed description of the fix with code examples
- **Files Modified**: Complete list of changed files and their purposes
- **Testing**: How to verify the fix works correctly
- **Deployment**: Step-by-step instructions for production rollout
- **Impact**: Summary of improvements and benefits

### Optional Sections
- **Related Issues**: Links to similar problems or dependencies
- **Future Improvements**: Suggestions for further enhancements
- **References**: Links to relevant documentation or resources

## File Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the fix:
- `ORGANISATION_DEFAULT_FIX.md` - Fix for organisation default issues
- `FOLDER_DELETION_FIX.md` - Fix for folder deletion problems
- `[ISSUE_TYPE]_[DESCRIPTION]_FIX.md` - General pattern

## Frontmatter Requirements

Each fix file must include proper frontmatter:

```yaml
---
sidebar_position: [number]
title: [Fix Name]
description: [Brief description of the fix]
---
```

## Contributing

When adding new fix documentation:

1. **Create the fix file** with proper frontmatter
2. **Update the index.md** to include the new fix
3. **Follow the template** structure provided in index.md
4. **Include code examples** where relevant
5. **Add deployment instructions** for production use
6. **Test the documentation** locally if possible

## Categories

Fixes are categorized by type:

- **Database & Migration**: Schema updates, data integrity, migrations
- **File System**: Folder management, file handling, storage issues
- **Service Layer**: Missing methods, error handling, performance
- **API & Integration**: Endpoint fixes, external service integration
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Performance**: Optimization, caching, resource management

## Maintenance

- **Keep documentation current** with code changes
- **Update deployment instructions** as environments change
- **Archive obsolete fixes** when they're no longer relevant
- **Link related fixes** together when appropriate
- **Review and update** periodically for accuracy
