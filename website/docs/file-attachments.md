## **Setup**

[!NOTE] 
If you press the button 'view files' and a screen shows up that there are no files in the folder, while you actually have uploaded a file, you probably have not been added to the openregister share properly. Please check if you are in the openregister user group.

[!WARNING]
Under no circumstances you should add files in an Open Registers folder if the Open Registers is not shown in your file app natively. This would trigger that the file is created in your own user folder, making reconciling the shared folder and your user folder quite difficult.
