    feat: reduce retry time and enhance setup loading explanation
    
    Retry Time Optimization:
    - Reduce maximum retry attempts from 8 to 6 (120 seconds vs 260 seconds)
    - More reasonable timeout for production environments
    - Still provides adequate retry coverage: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 seconds
    
    Enhanced Loading Modal:
    - Add detailed explanation of setup process steps
    - Visual breakdown: Connectivity → ConfigSet → Propagation → Collection → Schema
    - Explain WHY setup takes time (ZooKeeper propagation, cluster coordination)
    - Set proper expectations: 1-3 minutes depending on cluster size
    - Educational content reduces user anxiety during wait times
    
    User Experience Improvements:
    - Users understand what's happening during setup
    - Clear explanation of distributed SOLR complexity
    - Professional loading experience with step-by-step breakdown
    - Reduces support tickets about 'slow setup' complaints
    - Sets realistic timing expectations upfront
    
    This balances reasonable timeout limits with excellent user education
    about the technical processes happening behind the scenes.
