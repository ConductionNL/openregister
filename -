    <violation beginline="1" rule="Blob / God object" ruleset="Blob / God object" externalInfoUrl="http://www.phpmetrics.org/documentation/index.html" priority="2">            A blob object (or "god class") does not follow the Single responsibility principle.

            * object has lot of public methods  (38, excluding getters and setters)
            * object has a high Lack of cohesion of methods (LCOM=10)
            * object knows everything (and use lot of external classes)

            Maybe you should reducing the number of methods splitting this object in many sub objects.</violation>
    <violation beginline="1" rule="Too complex class code" ruleset="Too complex class code" externalInfoUrl="http://www.phpmetrics.org/documentation/index.html" priority="2">            This class looks really complex.

            * Algorithms are complex (Total cyclomatic complexity of class is 521)
            * Component uses 1546 operators

            Maybe you should delegate some code to other objects.</violation>
    <violation beginline="1" rule="Too complex method code" ruleset="Too complex method code" externalInfoUrl="http://www.phpmetrics.org/documentation/index.html" priority="2">            This class looks really complex.

            * Algorithms are complex (Max cyclomatic complexity of class methods is 56)

            Maybe you should delegate some code to other objects or split complex method.</violation>
    <violation beginline="1" rule="Probably bugged" ruleset="Probably bugged" externalInfoUrl="http://www.phpmetrics.org/documentation/index.html" priority="3">            This component contains in theory 17.73 bugs.

            * Calculation is based on number of operators, operands, cyclomatic complexity
            * See more details at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halstead_complexity_measures
            *  testsuites has dependency to this class.

            Maybe you should check your unit tests for this class.</violation>
    <violation beginline="1" rule="Too long" ruleset="Too long" externalInfoUrl="http://www.phpmetrics.org/documentation/index.html" priority="4">            This class looks really long.

            * Class has 1833 logical lines of code
            * Class has 3788 lines of code

            Maybe your class should not exceed 200 lines of logical code</violation>
    <violation beginline="1" rule="Too dependent" ruleset="Too dependent" externalInfoUrl="http://www.phpmetrics.org/documentation/index.html" priority="4">            This class looks use really high number of components.

            * Efferent coupling is 40, so this class uses 40 different external components.

            Maybe you should check why this class has lot of dependencies.</violation>
